# Feature Specification: Kaiten SDK Core

**Feature Branch**: `001-kaiten-sdk-core`
**Created**: 2026-02-14
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: A Swift library for working with the Kaiten API. Fetching cards, boards, fields (assignees, teams, platforms). Will be used as a dependency in the MCP server.

## User Scenarios & Testing

### User Story 1 — Get a Card by ID (Priority: P1)

A developer (or MCP server) requests card details by its ID. Receives all fields: title, description, status, assignees, custom properties (team, platform).

**Why this priority**: This is the fundamental operation — nothing works without it.

**Independent Test**: Call `client.getCard(id: 123)`, receive a `Card` struct with all fields.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a valid token and card ID, **When** I call `getCard(id:)`, **Then** I receive a `Card` with all fields including custom properties
2. **Given** an invalid ID, **When** I call `getCard(id:)`, **Then** I receive a typed error (no crash)
3. **Given** an invalid token, **When** I call `getCard(id:)`, **Then** I receive an authorization error

---

### User Story 2 — Get a List of Cards on a Board (Priority: P1)

A developer requests all cards for a specific board. Receives a list with basic fields + assignees.

**Why this priority**: Needed for board overview — who is working on what, what status things are in.

**Independent Test**: Call `client.listCards(boardId: 456)`, receive an array `[Card]`.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a valid board ID, **When** I call `listCards(boardId:)`, **Then** I receive an array of cards with fields
2. **Given** a board with no cards, **When** I call `listCards(boardId:)`, **Then** I receive an empty array
3. **Given** an invalid board ID, **When** I call `listCards(boardId:)`, **Then** I receive a typed error

---

### User Story 3 — Get Members and Custom Properties of a Card (Priority: P1)

A developer retrieves information about who is assigned to a card (members), which team it belongs to, and which platform it's on (via custom properties).

**Why this priority**: Key for planning — understanding people and team workload.

**Independent Test**: From a fetched `Card`, read `members`, `customProperties` and get typed values.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a card with members, **When** I read `card.members`, **Then** I receive an array `[Member]` with `userId`, `fullName`, `role`
2. **Given** a card with custom properties, **When** I read `card.customProperties`, **Then** I receive a dictionary with typed values
3. **Given** a card without members, **When** I read `card.members`, **Then** I receive an empty array

---

### User Story 4 — Get Board Structure (Priority: P2)

A developer requests a board with its columns and lanes — to understand which column each card is in.

**Why this priority**: Needed for visualization and understanding the flow, but does not block core work.

**Independent Test**: Call `client.getBoard(id:)`, receive a `Board` with `columns` and `lanes`.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a valid board ID, **When** I call `getBoard(id:)`, **Then** I receive a `Board` with `columns` and `lanes` arrays

---

### User Story 5 — Get List of Spaces and Boards (Priority: P2)

A developer requests all spaces and boards — for navigation.

**Why this priority**: Auxiliary navigation, not critical for the first version.

**Independent Test**: Call `client.listSpaces()`, then `client.listBoards(spaceId:)`.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a valid token, **When** I call `listSpaces()`, **Then** I receive an array `[Space]`
2. **Given** a valid space ID, **When** I call `listBoards(spaceId:)`, **Then** I receive an array `[Board]`

### Edge Cases

- What happens on a network error (timeout, DNS)? → typed error, no crash
- What if the API returns unknown fields? → they are ignored (forward compatibility)
- What if the API returns 429 (rate limit)? → automatic retry with delay via `Task.retrying`
- What if a custom property has an unknown type? → stored as raw value

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: SDK MUST generate client code from the OpenAPI spec via `swift-openapi-generator`
- **FR-002**: SDK MUST support authorization via Bearer token
- **FR-003**: SDK MUST provide typed models for Card, Board, Column, Lane, Space, Member, CustomProperty
- **FR-004**: SDK MUST return typed errors for all failure cases (network, auth, not found, rate limit). All public methods MUST use typed throws (`throws(KaitenError)`) instead of untyped `throws`.
- **FR-005**: SDK MUST accept `baseURL` and `token` as
  explicit initialization parameters. The SDK does not read
  configuration on its own — that is the caller's responsibility.
- **FR-006**: SDK MUST throw an error on initialization
  (fail fast) if `baseURL` is invalid.
- **FR-007**: SDK MUST support async/await
- **FR-008**: The OpenAPI spec MUST contain only endpoints (`paths`) that are actually used in the SDK. The `components/schemas` section MUST contain all data models needed to fully describe responses of these endpoints — including nested objects (User, Checklist, SLA, etc.), even if the SDK has no special business logic for them. Since Kaiten does not yet have an official OpenAPI spec, we maintain a minimal hand-crafted spec — only used endpoints + complete models of their responses. When Kaiten provides an official spec, we can switch to it entirely.
- **FR-009**: The OpenAPI spec is assembled **manually** — Kaiten does not have a public OpenAPI specification. The spec MUST accurately reflect real API behavior:
  - **Kaiten documentation is the starting point**, but not absolute truth. Docs may diverge from the real API.
  - **When docs diverge from API — the real API takes priority.** Verify fields, types, nullable/required through real requests. Example: docs show a full Board for Card.board, but the API returns only 6 fields → the spec uses a separate CardBoardSummary schema.
  - **Divergences MUST be documented** with a YAML comment directly above the field/schema (e.g. `# NOTE: Kaiten docs show X, but API returns Y`).
  - **Different responses = different schemas** — if two endpoints return similar but not identical data, the spec MUST have separate schemas (Board vs BoardInSpace vs CardBoardSummary).
  - **Nullable and required strictly per the real API** — verify through requests, not just docs.
  - **Cross-checking is mandatory** — for any spec change, compare with documentation + verify against the real API. Documentation parsing guide: [docs/kaiten-docs-parsing.md](../../docs/kaiten-docs-parsing.md).
- **FR-010**: SDK MUST support ALL query parameters documented in the Kaiten API for every endpoint in the spec. No subset, no phasing — every filter the API accepts MUST be present in the OpenAPI spec and exposed in the SDK's public API with backward-compatible optional defaults.

### Non-Functional Requirements

- **NFR-001**: SDK MUST compile on macOS (ARM) and Linux (x86-64 and ARM)
- **NFR-002**: SDK MUST use `swift-tools-version: 6.2` with `.swiftLanguageMode(.v6)` on each target
- **NFR-003**: SDK MUST automatically retry requests on 429 (rate limit) with a delay (configurable max retries and delay). Implementation via `ClientMiddleware`.
- **NFR-004**: GitHub Actions workflows MUST have explicit names describing what they do (e.g. `build-and-test.yml`, not `ci.yml`)
- **NFR-005**: CI MUST cache SPM dependencies between runs to speed up builds
- **NFR-006**: Code MUST NOT use `nonisolated(unsafe)`. For mutable state in a Sendable context, use `Mutex` from `import Synchronization`
- **NFR-007**: All public types (structs, enums, protocols) and methods MUST have Swift doc comments (`///`) following DocC conventions. Doc comments MUST include `- Parameter`, `- Returns`, and `- Throws` tags where applicable.
- **NFR-008**: SDK source files MUST be grouped by Kaiten API documentation domains (for example: cards, boards, spaces, users) to keep endpoint parity checks maintainable.

### Key Entities

- **Card**: id, title, description, state, column, members, customProperties, tags, created, updated
- **Board**: id, title, columns, lanes
- **Column**: id, title, sortOrder, subcolumns
- **Lane**: id, title, sortOrder
- **Space**: id, title (boards fetched separately via `listBoards(spaceId:)`)
- **Member**: id, userId, fullName, role
- **CustomProperty**: id, name, type, value (typed: string, number, select, multiselect, date, user)
- **CustomPropertySelectValue**: id, customPropertyId, value, color, condition, sortOrder, externalId, updated, created, authorId, companyId

### User Story 7a — List and Get Custom Property Select Values (Priority: P2)

A developer retrieves the available select options for a select-type custom property, to populate dropdowns or validate user input.

**Why this priority**: Select values are needed for setting custom properties on cards — a key automation scenario.

**Independent Test**: Call `client.listCustomPropertySelectValues(propertyId: 299126)`, receive an array of select values.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a valid property ID of a select-type custom property, **When** I call `listCustomPropertySelectValues(propertyId:)`, **Then** I receive an array of `CustomPropertySelectValue` objects
2. **Given** a valid property ID and value ID, **When** I call `getCustomPropertySelectValue(propertyId:id:)`, **Then** I receive a single `CustomPropertySelectValue`
3. **Given** an invalid property ID, **When** I call `listCustomPropertySelectValues(propertyId:)`, **Then** I receive a `notFound` error
4. **Given** an invalid value ID, **When** I call `getCustomPropertySelectValue(propertyId:id:)`, **Then** I receive a `notFound` error

### User Story 7 — Create a Comment on a Card (Priority: P2)

A developer creates a new comment on a card with markdown text.

**Why this priority**: Write operations extend the SDK beyond read-only use, enabling automation workflows.

**Independent Test**: Call `client.createComment(cardId: 123, text: "Hello")`, receive a `Comment` with the created fields.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a valid card ID and text, **When** I call `createComment(cardId:text:)`, **Then** I receive a `Comment` with the created text
2. **Given** an invalid card ID, **When** I call `createComment(cardId:text:)`, **Then** I receive a `notFound` error
3. **Given** an invalid token, **When** I call `createComment(cardId:text:)`, **Then** I receive an `unauthorized` error

## Success Criteria

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: The MCP server can fetch all board cards with assignees and custom properties in a single SDK call
- **SC-002**: SDK compiles without errors on macOS (ARM) and Linux (x86-64 and ARM) in CI
- **SC-003**: All P1 user stories are covered by tests
- **SC-004**: Adding a new endpoint = adding it to the OpenAPI spec (code is regenerated automatically)
