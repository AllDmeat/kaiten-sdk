/// Filters for querying cards from the Kaiten API.

/// Use `CardFilter` to narrow down results when calling ``KaitenClient/listCards(boardId:columnId:laneId:offset:limit:filter:)``.
/// All properties are optional — only set the ones you need. Non-`nil` values are sent as
/// query parameters to the `GET /cards` endpoint; `nil` values are omitted.
///
/// ### Example: Find overdue cards assigned to specific members
/// ```swift
/// let cards = try await client.listCards(
///   filter: CardFilter(
///     memberIds: "10,25",
///     overdue: true
///   )
/// )
/// ```
///
/// ### Example: Search cards by text within a space
/// ```swift
/// let results = try await client.listCards(
///   filter: CardFilter(
///     query: "login bug",
///     searchFields: "title,description",
///     spaceId: 42
///   )
/// )
/// ```
///
/// ### Example: Filter by workflow state and date range
/// ```swift
/// let done = try await client.listCards(
///   filter: CardFilter(
///     createdAfter: oneWeekAgo,
///     states: [.done],
///     orderBy: "updated_at",
///     orderDirection: "desc"
///   )
/// )
/// ```
